        # Octopus Community Library: Bug Report
        Thanks for taking the time to fill out a bug/issue report!
        
        If you are reporting a bug with a specific step template, we'd really appreciate it if you could send a PR with a fix for the bug.
        If you want to send a PR but you're not sure how to create a PR, see GitHub's excellent [Pull Request guides](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests). Note that sending your own PR will give you a faster resolution than the below options.

        If you can't send a PR thats not a problem! A member of the Octopus team will take a look at your issue and make sure that we get any fix merged as soon as we can. 

        **Please note:** It might take a bit longer to publish a bug fix depending on what step template(s) are affected and what the issue is as it could require some setup to replicate.
